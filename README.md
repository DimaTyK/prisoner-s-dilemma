# prisoner-s-dilemma
1. So I started to do this game I think it was on suterday (05, 07, 2025) before the my schooll classes, let's see how long does it take me to make it all, with chat of course xD. 
2. I also trying to use github and use to computers (one on linuxOs(Zorin) and the next onw on Windows 11).
3. At the result of using two comps and weak LTE connection sometimes chat missing part of code and then it's callenge to concatenate it, but not too much :)).
4. With this game I also want to learning more about FastAPI.
